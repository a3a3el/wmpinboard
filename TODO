 wmpinboard
============

 Things TO DO
--------------

 - wait some more time, finally declare it stable and name it v1.0

 Things perhaps TO DO
----------------------

 Things I'm NOT going TO DO
----------------------------

 - Make wmpinboard pop up any external windows.  Why?

     See the man page, section "FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS".

 - Render rough sketches of the notes' contents in pinboard view.

     Judging by my personal experience, the notes' texts tend to cover them
     uniformly due to the limitation in size, so doing this would invariably
     result in just a mess of dark blobs.
