 wmpinboard
============

 License
---------

wmpinboard is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public license,
revision 2, or--at your choice--any later revision.  A copy of said document
is included with this source package.

 Requirements
--------------

 - an ANSI-compliant C compiler (preferably, GCC or one of its descendants)
 - X11R6 including header files (installed separately as "xdevel" or similar
   by some distributions)
 - the XPM library
 - wmpinboard is recommended to be run on a high-color (15bit or above) display

wmpinboard has reportedly been successfully compiled on the following
platforms:

 - Linux 2.0.x through 2.2.x, various setups
 - FreeBSD 3.1
 - Solaris 2.6

Reports about other platforms are always welcome.

 Installation
--------------

If you're too lazy to read the generic instructions in the INSTALL 
file, or already know how to install autoconf'ed programs in principle, 
here are the quick instructions that should suffice in 99% of all cases:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install-strip

The default prefix is "/usr/local".  If you want the binary and man 
page to go anywhere else, use configure's "--prefix" switch (see 
`configure --help`).  For further compile-time options, see configure's 
"--help" output.

 Upgrading from earlier versions
---------------------------------

If you're upgrading to wmpinboard 0.7+ from an earlier version, existing notes
will get lost due to some major changes concerning its data file format.
You can avoid this by running the included PERL script as the user in
question beforehand:

  $ perl /path/to/wmpinboard-x.x/wmpb-convert.pl
